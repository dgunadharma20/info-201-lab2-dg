# Write a function `money_conversion()` that takes in one numeric argument (`cents`) 
# that converts any number of cents to the equivalent

## from all elements in your vector of courses with a hyphen "-"


# Create a vector `numbers` that is the numbers 1 through 100

# Multiply all elements greater than 22 of the `numbers` vector with 2

# Create a list `student` that has four tagged elements, `first_name`, `last_name`, `net_id`, `favorite_courses` and `eligble_registration` where, 
# `first_name` is a character, 
# `last_name` is a character,
# `net_id` is a numeric,
# `favorite_courses` includes the courses vector you created previously,
# `eligble_registration` is a logical 
# give each element a value based off of yourselves

# Now, create a list without any tagged elements but give in the same values you gave for the previous list
